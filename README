Zeek Vulnerability Scan Detector
======================================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/lilyinstarlight/zeek-vuln-scan/Test)](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/zeek-vuln-scan/actions?query=workflow%3ATest)

A vulnerability scan detection script for Zeek. This script simply detects the difference between a basic scan and a vulnerability scan by whether a reasonable amount of data was transferred on a few ports or many hosts in a short period of time.

Many thanks to ncsa/bro-simple-scan on which this script is based.


Usage
-----

```sh
$ zkg install https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/zeek-vuln-scan.git
```
